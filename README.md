## LERCause: Deep Learning Approaches for Causal Sentence Identification from Nuclear Safety Reports
A repository of dataset and source code for the publication paper of causal sentence classification from nuclear safety reports
# How to use files
1. To get the results described in the paper, all the code was implemented on Python 3.10. To run the code, make sure that all packages in 'requirements.txt' file are installed. You can install them using pip. Type the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
 
         pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Download and unzip "ler_data.zip" file. You can find "LER_rawdata.csv" file that is the LER dataset used in the paper.

3. Open the jupyter notebook (e.g., "LER_BERT.ipynb") in your machine or a cloud computing platform you use. Place "LER_rawdata.csv" in the same directory where the jupyter notebook is located.

4. Detailed instruction on how to run each model is described in the notebook.
